Lung nodule classification using convolutional neural networks.

Diagnostic lung nodule classification using thoracic computed tomography (CT) and 2D convolutional neural networks. The project involves,
- Segmenting the annotated lung nodules and reading its corresponding nodule size from the dataset.
- Labelling the nodules as malignant or benign based on the size of the nodules.
- Dividing the dataset into training, testing and validation set.
- Using 2D- CNN to classify the lung nodules as malignant or benign.

Dataset:
The Lung Image Database Consortium image collection (LIDC-IDRI). It contains thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans of lung cancer with marked-up annotated nodules.
